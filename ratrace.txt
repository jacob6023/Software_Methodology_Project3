Rat Race
Job interview, check the mirror
keep that tie on straight
Breathing fast, king of the jungle
Ima Annihilate
Everything standing between me and my success
Cut to 10 years later I'm feeling some duress

Looking back i got guilt and regret up on my back
i got jealousy of people following dreams i never had
Everything was clear on the come-up I wanted it all
Give me money give me respect all I want is it all

Tip of the spear of one billion poor people
Had to succeed for me and my kind, that's my rat race
Only thing I feared was being a failure
But living life anxiously has drained the smile from my face
