    /*
     This is the user interface class to process the command lines entered on the terminal. An instance of this  class can process a single command line or multiple command lines at a time, including the empty lines.  You will lose 10 points if it cannot process multiple command lines.
     When your software starts running, it shall display "Scheduler is running.”. Next, it will  continuously read and process the command lines until the “Q” command is entered. If the Q command  is entered, display "Scheduler terminated", then the software stops normally. -2 points for  each violation.
     You must define a run() method that includes a while loop to continuously read the command lines until  a “Q” command is entered. You will lose 5 points if the run() method is missing. You MUST keep this  method under 40 lines for readability, or you will lose 3 points. You can define necessary instance  variables and private helper methods to handle each command.
